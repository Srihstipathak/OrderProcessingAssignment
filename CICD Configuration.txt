CI/CD Configuration
1. First, let's create the main CI/CD workflow:

```yaml:.github/workflows/main.yml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Setup .NET
      uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3
      with:
        dotnet-version: '8.0.x'
        
    - name: Restore dependencies
      run: dotnet restore
      
    - name: Build
      run: dotnet build --no-restore --configuration Release
      
    - name: Test
      run: dotnet test --no-build --configuration Release --verbosity normal --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
      
    - name: Upload coverage reports
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
      
    - name: Publish
      if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
      run: dotnet publish --no-build --configuration Release --output ./publish
      
    - name: Upload artifact
      if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: webapp
        path: ./publish


2. Create a workflow for code quality checks:
name: Code Quality

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  analyze:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Setup .NET
      uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3
      with:
        dotnet-version: '8.0.x'
        
    - name: Install SonarCloud scanner
      run: dotnet tool install --global dotnet-sonarscanner
        
    - name: Begin SonarCloud analysis
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
      run: dotnet sonarscanner begin /k:"your-project-key" /o:"your-organization" /d:sonar.host.url="https://sonarcloud.io" /d:sonar.login="${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}"
      
    - name: Build
      run: dotnet build
      
    - name: End SonarCloud analysis
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
      run: dotnet sonarscanner end /d:sonar.login="${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}"

3. Create a deployment workflow:

```yaml:.github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to Azure

on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["CI/CD Pipeline"]
    branches: [main]
    types:
      - completed

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success' }}
    
    steps:
    - name: Download artifact
      uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: webapp
        
    - name: Deploy to Azure Web App
      uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
      with:
        app-name: 'your-app-name'
        publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE }}
        package: .
```

4. Create a security scanning workflow:

```yaml:.github/workflows/security.yml
name: Security Scan

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Run weekly
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Run OWASP ZAP Scan
      uses: zaproxy/action-full-scan@v0.4.0
      with:
        target: 'https://your-deployed-app-url.com'
        
    - name: Run Snyk to check for vulnerabilities
      uses: snyk/actions/dotnet@master
      env:
        SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
```

5. Create a pull request validation workflow:

```yaml:.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml
name: PR Validation

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Setup .NET
      uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3
      with:
        dotnet-version: '8.0.x'
        
    - name: Restore dependencies
      run: dotnet restore
      
3. Configure the necessary secrets in your GitHub repository:
    - name: Build
      run: dotnet build --no-restore
      
    - name: Test
      run: dotnet test --no-build --verbosity normal
      
    - name: Check code formatting
      run: |
        dotnet tool install -g dotnet-format
        dotnet format --verify-no-changes
```
To set this up:

1. Create the `.github/workflows` directory in your repository:
```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

2. Add these workflow files to the directory.

3. Configure the necessary secrets in your GitHub repository:
-Go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
Add the following secrets:
AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE
SONAR_TOKEN
SNYK_TOKEN
Update the configuration files with your specific values:
Replace your-app-name with your Azure Web App name
Replace your-project-key and your-organization with your SonarCloud details
Replace your-deployed-app-url.com with your actual deployed application URL
Set up branch protection rules:
Go to Settings > Branches
Add a rule for the main branch
Enable:
Require status checks to pass before merging
Require branches to be up to date before merging
Include administrators in these restrictions
This CI/CD configuration provides:
Automated build and test on every push and pull request
Code quality analysis with SonarCloud
Security scanning with OWASP ZAP and Snyk
Automated deployment to Azure
Pull request validation
Code coverage reporting
Weekly security scans
The workflows are set up to:
Build and test the code
Run code quality checks
Perform security scanning
Deploy to Azure (only on main branch)
Validate pull requests
Remember to:
Test the workflows in a development environment first
Monitor the workflow runs and adjust as needed
Keep secrets secure and rotate them periodically
Review and update the configuration as your project evolves
```
